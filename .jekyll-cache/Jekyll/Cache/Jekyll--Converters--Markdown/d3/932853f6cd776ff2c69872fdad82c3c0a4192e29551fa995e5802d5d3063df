<p>I read this quote from Jen Pahlka in Tim Oâ€™Reillyâ€™s book â€œWTF? Whatâ€™s the Future and Why Itâ€™s Up to Usâ€, and it really resonated with me. It seems that there are so many people in our society that the first part of quote describes perfectly. They compare any difficulties of today to the â€œgood old daysâ€, and wonder why things have to be different. I feel a bit sad for them.</p>

<p>In the second part of the quote, there is a sense of optimism and excitement. Maybe the status quo is pretty good, or has been in the past for some people. But part of what drives us as a species is that there is always room for improvement. We can build better things, use less resources, and remove structural biases that are part of the status quo.</p>

<p>Living in Alberta, I see this all the time with the oil and gas industry. That industry has been very good to a lot of people, to the province, and to Canada for a long time now. Itâ€™s understandable that people will do whatever they can to protect it. But that desire to protect also seems to blind them from the potential of the future. Itâ€™s easy to say that oil will be needed for as long as weâ€™re around, and therefore we need to do everything we can to protect the industry. But that view doesnâ€™t see the possible future where we <strong>donâ€™t</strong> need oil. It wonâ€™t happen tomorrow, or even next year. However, if we focus our energy on creating that future it will happen.</p>

<p>I wanted to start this blog with Jenâ€™s quote as it does a good job of setting the tone, and to guide my purpose in writing. â€œFight for something betterâ€ doesnâ€™t have to be as grand as inventing a future without oil (as important as that is), but it does start with fighting to make yourself better. Once you start making yourself better, the possibilities of â€œsomething we havenâ€™t seen yetâ€ become clearer. And thatâ€™s the exciting part.</p>
