  <h1>Aside</h1>

  <p>Just a quick note. I am purposefully not spending much time reviewing and editing any of my posts right now. This is so that I can start getting into the habit of writing, without the extra baggage associated with making the perfect post. Hopefully, as I get into the groove I’ll develop a better writing style and spend more time developing my thoughts.</p>

<p>For now though, it’s just getting words out there.</p>
