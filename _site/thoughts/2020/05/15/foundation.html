<p>The emerging norm for web development is to build a React single-page application, with server rendering. The two key elements of this architecture are something like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The main UI is built &amp; updated in JavaScript using React or something similar.
The backend is an API that that application makes requests against.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This idea has really swept the internet. It started with a few major popular websites and has crept into corners like marketing sites and blogs.</p>

<p>I’m increasingly skeptical of it.</p>

<p>There is a sweet spot of React: in moderately interactive interfaces. Complex forms that require immediate feedback, UIs that need to move around and react instantly. That’s where it excels. I helped build the editors in Mapbox Studio and Observable and for the most part, React was a great choice.</p>

<p>But there’s a lot on either side of that sweet spot.</p>
