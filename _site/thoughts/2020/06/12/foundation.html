  <p>The status quo isn’t worth protecting. It’s so easy to be in reaction, on the defensive, fighting for the world we had yesterday. Fight for something better, something we haven’t seen yet, something we have to invent.</p>

  <p>– Jen Pahlka</p>

<p>I read this quote from Jen Pahlka in Tim O’Reilly’s book “WTF? What’s the Future and Why It’s Up to Us”, and it has really resonated with me. It seems that there are too many people in our society that view the world like the first part of quote. They compare any difficulties of today to the “good old days”, and wonder why things have to be different. I feel a bit sad for them.</p>

<p>In the second part of the quote, there is a sense of optimism and excitement. Maybe the status quo is pretty good, or has been in the past for some people. But part of what drives us as a species is that there is always room for improvement. We can build better things, use less resources, and remove structural biases that are part of the status quo.</p>

<p>Living in Alberta, I see this all the time with the oil and gas industry. That industry has been very good to a lot of people, to the province, and to Canada for a long time. It’s understandable that people will do whatever they can to protect it. But that desire to protect also seems to blind people from the potential that the future holds. It’s easy to say that oil will be needed for as long as we’re around, and therefore we need to do everything we can to protect the industry. But that view doesn’t see the possible future where we <strong>don’t</strong> need oil. That’s the exciting future, and the one I’d rather be part of. It won’t happen tomorrow, or even next year. However, if we focus our energy on creating that future it will happen.</p>

<p>I wanted to start this blog with Jen’s quote as it does a good job of setting the tone, and to guide my purpose in writing. “Fight for something better” doesn’t have to be as grand as inventing a future without oil (as important as that is), but it does start with fighting to make yourself better. Once you start making yourself better, the possibilities of “something we haven’t seen yet” become clearer. And that’s the exciting part.</p>
